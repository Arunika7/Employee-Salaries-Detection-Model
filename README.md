# Employee Salaries Detection Model

This project predicts employee salaries based on their years of experience using a simple Linear Regression Machine Learning model.

## 📌 Project Overview
The aim is to help organizations estimate fair salaries for employees based on experience data. This can reduce bias and manual errors in salary decisions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## 📊 Dataset
A simple CSV file with two columns:
- `Experience` (in years)
- `Salary` (in INR)

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train a Linear Regression model
4. Predict salary values
5. Evaluate using R² Score and MSE
6. Predict salary for new inputs (e.g., 5.0 years)

## 📈 Output Example
- Input: 5 years of experience  
- Predicted Salary: ₹73,756 (approx)
